# Emotion-Detection-using-CNN
Leveraging CNNs and ResNets for Deep Learning-based Facial Emotion Recognition.

## Project Goals
-Design and train a CNN-based model for facial emotion recognition.
-Evaluate the effectiveness of ResNets in improving emotion classification accuracy.

## Prerequisites
-Python (version 3.x recommended)
-Deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
-NumPy, pandas, matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)

## Getting Started

1. Prepare data:
-Download FER-2013 Kaggle Dataset
-Preprocess the data (resize, grayscale conversion, normalization)
-Split the data into training, validation, and test sets

2. Train the model:
-Define the CNN architecture (including ResNets)
-Compile the model with an Adam optimizer and loss function
-Train the model on the training data, monitoring validation performance

3. Evaluate the model:
-Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set
-Visualize results (confusion matrix, sample predictions)

4. Saving and Loading the Model
-Use the model.save() function to save the model architecture, weights, and training configuration. (This allows you to load the model later for prediction or real-time applications without retraining.)

5. Predictions
-Predicting the emotion of a sample image using model.predict()

## Additional Notes
-Specific implementation details may vary based on libraries and datasets.
-Experimentation is crucial for optimal model performance.
